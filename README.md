# LoneEchoSubtitles
Adds a window with realtime subtitles for Lone Echo

## Usage Instructions
 - Run the exe
 - If your game isn't installed to "C:\Program Files\Oculus\Software\Software\ready-at-dawn-lone-echo" like mine is, then you'll have to use the Browse button to find your "ready-at-dawn-lone-echo" folder.
 - You can pin a window to the screen so it's visible even in an app by using the + icon on the Oculus Dash bar and using the pin icon on the bottom right or by pressing "b" and clicking on "Pin"
 - Use the grip button to move the window in Oculus Dash
